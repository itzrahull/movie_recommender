## ▶️ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the **Movie Recommender System** from scratch:

### 📥 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system
```

### 📦 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🧠 3. Generate Required `.pkl` Files

Run the notebook that prepares the dataset and similarity matrix:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

> This will create:
>
> * `movie_list.pkl`
> * `similarity.pkl`

in the same directory.

### 🚀 4. Launch the App

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
